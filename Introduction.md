* JavaScript is just a programming language for web applications.

* The programs in this language are called scripts.

* We can use Visual Studio for write our code.

* Also we can use a extension in Visual Studio that is "LiveServer" which can be use for compile our code to browser.

* We can use JavaScript two diffrent ways.
    1.Internal Linking
    2.External Linking

* For make sure our script is working fine we can use "Console" in browsers to trace back our code.
