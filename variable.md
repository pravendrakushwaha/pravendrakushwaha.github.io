A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.

also we create a vaiable in JavaScript, use the 'var' keyword but the thing is there is one major diffrence if u declare 'var' in main u can access it in all over global area but 'let' cant use out of the block. 

if u dont use 'let' or var it will automatically define it as a 'var'

* $ and _ are allowd as variable names
* u cannt redefine a variable 
* hyphen not allow in variable name
* if we use 'use strict' in our code then we hv to define variable first
* case senisitive exist
* we can use non latin words as a var name but not recommondate as good approace

here is one more variable 'const' which can use for static value.
we cant not change value of const variable after define.
for the good approach use const variable name like this COLOR_RED COLOR_GREEN.
